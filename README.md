# Comfy INT8 Acceleration

This node speeds up Flux2, Chroma, Z-Image, Ernie Image in ComfyUI by using INT8 quantization, delivering between 1.5~2x faster inference on my 3090 depending on the model. It should work on any NVIDIA GPU with enough INT8 TOPS. It's unlikely to be faster than proper FP8 on 40-Series and above. 
Works with lora, torch compile (needed to get full speedup).

Pre-quantized checkpoints were recommended for most architectures, but on-the-fly quantization with ConvRot is better in all cases.
However, ConvRot is also a little slower, so these prequantized models are still useful.

**Shoutout to [vistralis](https://huggingface.co/vistralis) for these:** 
Make sure to update the node to use them as int8 row-wise was added.

*Z-Image Base weights have been Deprecated in favor of Convrot OTF, which is higher quality.

# Requirements:
Working ComfyKitchen (needs latest comfy and possibly pytorch with cu130)

Triton

Windows untested, but I hear triton-windows exists.

If you have a 30-Series GPU, OneTrainer is also the fastest current lora trainer thanks to this. Please go check them out!!
